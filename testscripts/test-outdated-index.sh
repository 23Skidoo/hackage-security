# Cache incoherence test 2: outdated index
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
# The general approach is the same as in test 1, except we now set things up
# so that the cache has an outdated index.
#
# EXPECTED OUTCOME
#
# We should recover from the cache incoherence problem and still download the
# index incrementally (rather than downloading the entire index from scratch).
# See example log file for a succcessful run.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS
#
# Since this relies on incremental downloads, it must currently be tested
# against Apache rather than Hackage. Make sure to have
#
#Â   Header set Cache-Control "max-age=5, public, no-transform"
#
# in your .htaccess (and set AllowOverride: All for your domain, if necessary).
# As for test 1, you should also have a fresh instance of squid running.
