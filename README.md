# Hackage Security

This is a library for Hackage security based on
[TUF, The Update Framework](http://theupdateframework.com/).

## Comparison with TUF

In this section we highlight some of the differences in the specifics of the
implementation; generally we try to follow the TUF model as closely as
possible.

This section is not (currently) intended to be complete.

### Targets

#### Package versions

Each version of each package is stored in a directory `targets/Foo/1.0` which
contains a `targets.json` which is specfic to this version of this package,
containing precisely two entries:

```
{ "signed" : {
      "_type"   : "Targets"
    , "version" : VERSION
    , "expires" : EXPIRES
    , "targets" : {
          "Foo-1.0.tar.gz" : FILEINFO
        , "Foo-1.0.cabal"  : FILEINFO
       }
, "signatures" : <signatures from package maintainers>
}
```

where the SIGNATURES must be signed by the package maintainers (once we add
support for that). In addition it contains a file `revisions.json` which
revisions of the Cabal file:

```
{ "signed" : {
      "_type"   : "Targets"
    , "version" : VERSION
    , "expires" : EXPIRES
    , "targets" : {
          "Foo-1.0-rev1.cabal" : FILEINFO
        , "Foo-1.0-rev2.cabal" : FILEINFO
        , ...
       }
, "signatures" : <signatures from package maintainers or trustees>
}
```

This file is either signed by the package authors or by the Hackage trustees.

The expiry date for packages can probably be set to "never"; expiry dates are
there to ensure that clients don't get older versions of the files than are
available, but this is not applicable to immutable files (such as packages).

#### Packages

For each package we record a single `targets.json` in `Foo/targets.json` with
delegation information:

```
{ "signed" : {
      "_type"       : "Targets"
    , "version"     : VERSION
    , "expires"     : EXPIRES
    , "targets"     : {}
    , "delegations" : {
          "keys"  : <package maintainer keys>
        , "roles" : [
              { "name"      : "*/targets.json"
              , "keyids"    : <package maintainer key IDs>
              , "threshold" : THRESHOLD
              , "path"      : "*/*"
              }
            , { "name"      : "*/revisions.json"
              , "keyids"    : <package maintainer key IDs>
              , "threshold" : THRESHOLD
              , "path"      : "*/*.cabal"
              }
            ]
    }
, "signatures" : <signatures from top-level target keys>
}
```

This uses a minor extension to TUF: we can use globs to specify path patterns,
and then refer to the matching wildcards in the role name. This means that we
don't need to change this file whenever a new package version is uploaded.
(NOTE: This means that we list a _single_ path with a _single_ replacement
name. Alternatively, we could have a list of pairs of paths and names.)

This file is signed by the Hackage admins, using offline top-level targets keys.
The "keys" part of "delegations" lists this package maintainer keys (if any).
Then it lists two roles:

1. It lists that any file can be recorded in the package version's
   `targets.json`; the key IDs here should equal the list of package
   maintainer keys. The threshold can be set to 0 for packages for which
   we do not use author signing (or before we have added support for author
   signing).

2. It lists that the `.cabal` files can be signed in the `revisions.json`.
   As above, the key IDs should be the package maintainer keys. Hackage
   trustees can also sign revisions, but this is recorded at the top-level
   (see below).

#### Top-level

The top-level `targets.json` also lists only delegation information.

```
{ signed: {
      "_type"       : "Targets"
    , "version"     : VERSION
    , "expires"     : EXPIRES
    , "targets"     : {}
    , "delegations" : {
          "keys"  : <Hackage trustee keys>
        , "roles" : [
              { "name"      : "targets/*/targets.json"
              , "keyids"    : <top-level target keys>
              , "threshold" : THRESHOLD
              , "path"      : "targets/*/*/*"
              }
            , { "name"      : "targets/*/*/revisions.json"
              , "keyids"    : <Hackage trustee key IDs>
              , "threshold" : THRESHOLD
              , "path"      : "targets/*/*/*.cabal"
              }
            ]
    }
, "signatures" : <signatures from top level target keys>
}
```

As for the per-package `targets.json`, this lists two pieces of information:

1. Any path at all (such as `targets/Foo/1.0/Foo-1.0.gz`) will have it's
   delegation information in `targets/Foo/targets.json`. This means that we
   then further delegate per package to the package maintainers.
2. In addition, any `.cabal` file can be signed by the Hackage trustees.
   By listing this at the top-level, we only need to list the valid Hackage
   trustee key IDs once at top-level, rather than having to update each
   package whenever we add a new Hackage trustee (of course, we might still have
   to resign when we rotate trustee IDs, but that's inevitable.)

This file is signed by the Hackage admins (using off-line top-level target
keys), and delegates to per-package `targets.json` files signed with those same
keys. The point of this delegation is not security, but rather to reduce the
granularity of the files that require updating whenever we update something.

The way we've set things up, when a brand new package is introduced to Hackage,
the Hackage admins need to sign only a single `targets.json` file
(`NewFoo/targets.json`); similarly, for every new version that is added, authors
only need to sign `NewFoo/2.0/targets.json` (and trustees only need to sign the
`revisions.json` file when they make add a new `.cabal` file revision).

TODO: The threshold for Hackage trustees should probably be set to 1, but we
might want to be able to override this for specific more sensitive packages;
indeed, for some packages we may want to disable trustee signing completely.
If we want that, we might want to some sort 'priority' scheme for delegation
rules; the TUF spec mentions that this might be desirable but does not make
any specific recommendations.

### Snapshot

#### Interaction with the index tarball

According to the official specification we should have a file `snapshot.json`,
signed with the snapshot key, which lists the hashes of _all_ metadata files
in the repo. In Hackage however we have the index tarball, which _contains_
all metadata files in the repo (that is, it contains all the `.cabal` files,
but it also contains all the `targets.json` files, as well as the `root.json`
file). The only thing that is missing from the index tarball, compared to the
`snapshot.json` file from the TUF spec, is the version, expiry time, and
signatures. Therefore our `snapshot.json` looks like

```
{ "signed" : {
      "_type"   : "Snapshot"
    , "version" : VERSION
    , "expires" : EXPIRES
    , "meta"    : {
           "index.tar"    : FILEINFO
         , "index.tar.gz" : FILEINFO
        }
    }
, "signatures" : <signatures from snapshot key>
}
```

Then the combination of `snapshot.json` together with the index tarball is
a strict superset of the information in TUF's `snapshot.json` (instead of
containing the hashes of the metadata in the repo, it contains the actual
metadata themselves).

#### Efficiency of requests

Since our `snapshot.json` contains only a single entry (corresponding to the
index tarball), it becomes very similar to in function to `timestamp.json`.
However, it is logically different and signed with a different key. Admittedly,
in our current setup both the timestamp and the snapshot keys will be kept on
the same server, but this may not be the case in the future.  

In order to keep the comparison with TUF as clear as possible we will keep
these files separate. However, since the size of our `snapshot.json` is
essentially fixed (unlike in standard TUF) we can safely download both the
timestamp and the snapshot in one go, without exposing ourselves to a
potential endless data attack. To make the initial HTTP request more efficient,
we can easily bundle both `timestamp.json` and `snapshot.json` in a single JSON
file:

```
{ "timestamp.json": { "signed": ..., "signatures": ... }
, "snapshot.json" : { "signed": ..., "signatures": ... }
}
```

##Â Open questions

* The set of maintainers of a package can change over time, and can even change
  so much that the old maintainers of a package are no longer maintainters.
  But we would still like to be able to install and verify old packages. How
  do we deal with this?

* In the spec as defined we list each revision of a cabal file separately
  (`Foo-1.0-rev1.cabal`), but in the tarball these entries actually _overwrite_
  each other (they all have the same filename). We need to define precisely
  how we deal with this.
